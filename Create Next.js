Based on your query, it seems you might be looking for information on updating Next.js, possibly with a small typo in the version name. The latest version as of now is Next.js 15.5, released in August 2025.

Here is a guide on how to update your Next.js project.

üõ†Ô∏è How to Update Next.js

You have two main paths to update your project: an automated method using a codemod or a manual update. The automated method is generally recommended.

Method Command Best For
Automated (Recommended) npx @next/codemod@canary upgrade latest Most users; handles common code migrations automatically.
Manual Update npm install next@latest react@latest react-dom@latest eslint-config-next@latest Users who prefer full control or have complex project setups.

After running the update commands, it's a good practice to check your package.json file to confirm that the versions of next, react, and react-dom have been updated correctly.

‚ú® What's New in Next.js 15.5

Updating gives you access to the latest features and improvements. Here are some highlights from version 15.5:

¬∑ Turbopack Builds (Beta): You can now use Turbopack for production builds with next build --turbopack, which can lead to significantly faster build times, especially for larger projects.
¬∑ Stable Node.js Middleware: Middleware can now officially run in the Node.js runtime, giving you access to the full Node.js ecosystem of packages within your middleware logic.
¬∑ Enhanced TypeScript Support: This version brings more robust type safety to routing, including stable "typed routes" that help catch invalid links during development.
¬∑ Deprecation Warnings: The release includes warnings for features that will be removed in the upcoming Next.js 16, such as AMP support and the legacyBehavior prop for the Link component, giving you time to prepare.

üí° Important Considerations Before Updating

¬∑ Review Breaking Changes: Version 15 introduced breaking changes, such as making previously synchronous APIs (like cookies() and headers()) asynchronous. Be sure to review the official upgrade guide for version 15 to adjust your code accordingly.
¬∑ Check for Security Updates: If you are updating from an older version, ensure you are moving to a patched release. For instance, versions before 15.2.3 were affected by a middleware security vulnerability (CVE-2025-29927), which has been fixed in newer releases.

I hope this helps you successfully update your Next.js project. If you run into any specific errors during the process or have questions about a particular new feature, feel free to ask
